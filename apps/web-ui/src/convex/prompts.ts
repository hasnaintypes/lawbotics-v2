2. For {{ANALYSIS_BIAS}} bias:
   - "neutral": Provide balanced analysis without bias
   - "favorable": Highlight advantages for the selected party
   - "risk": Focus on potential risks and issues
3. For {{ANALYSIS_DEPTH}} depth:
   - "summary": Provide a concise overview with fewer details
   - "full": Provide comprehensive analysis with all details
4. Format the response as a valid JSON object with the structure shown above.
5. Extract accurate document metadata including title, type, status, parties, dates, and value.
6. Calculate a risk score from 0-100 based on the overall risk assessment.
7. Identify 3-5 key clauses with their section references, text, importance, analysis, and recommendations.
8. Identify 2-4 negotiable terms with current language, suggested alternatives, and rationale.
9. Highlight 2-4 red flags with severity ratings and specific locations.
10. Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations.
11. Include an overall impression with a summary, 3-5 pros, 3-5 cons, and a conclusion.
